Our project is based on the creation of an interactive web application to teach musical instruments online.<br>
The intention is that the user can interact with the instruments and have a high quality musical exploration and learning experience.

# *Description of the project* <img width = 50px, height = 50px src="https://github.com/nati-Bel/Proyecto-3---Music-App/assets/132446932/53786f41-5b13-4265-a20d-a478d3aaff27">
The music school MusicTutor, has requested the development of an interactive web application to teach musical instruments online. 

The expected operation is that when the user clicks/taps a key/tap(mobile) on each of the "pads" of the instrument, so that it emits the corresponding sound/note. 

The client wants the design of a landing page with a functional drum set, as a demo to attract customers, since it is an instrument with a large audience. At the same time, a second instrument is proposed to improve the user experience.

An example of how our landing page looks like can be found in the following image:

# *Functionalities* <img width = 50px, height = 50px src="https://github.com/nati-Bel/Proyecto-3---Music-App/assets/132446932/cd1cfd60-fde6-423f-a2b0-638571ee0b00">
Each drum pad is associated with a click event.<br>
Clicking on a pad plays the sound corresponding to the selected pad.

Each drum pad is associated to a keyboard event and has a key assigned to play the corresponding sound when pressed.

The drum pads have visual animations that increase in size when clicked or when the associated key is pressed.


# *How users can use it* <img width = 50px, height = 50px src="https://github.com/nati-Bel/Proyecto-3---Music-App/assets/132446932/267ff4c9-035a-4a54-8f0f-f708271c3538">
Users can access the page from the following link: https://nati-bel.github.io/Proyecto-3---Music-App/ <br>

Once inside, the user can test the functionalities of the musical drum kit using their mouse, keyboard or finger (when using it on their smart phone). By doing so, he/she will be able to see and hear the animations that are programmed.
